    <Fact name="Heart">

      <FactA>
        Your heart is in your chest
        and is protected
        by your rib cage.
        Blood is the fluid that provides the body
        with oxygen and nutrients.
        The heart is very important,
        it is the organ
        that pumps blood throughout the body.
        The study of the heart is
        cardiology.
        Blood that goes towards the
        heart is carried
        through tubes called veins.
        Blood that leaves the heart
        that goes to the
        other organs,
        Are carried through tubes
        called arteries.
        the ratio of red blood cells to
        white is 600:1
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        Average heart valve is
        the size of a
        half dollar coin.
        The first heart cell
        starts to beat at
        around four weeks.
        A blue whale has the largest heart.
        A heart is about the
        size of your two hands
        grabbing each other.
        Your heart beats about
        100,000 times a day.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        Your heart pumps around 788,400 gallons of
        blood each year, and 1.5 each day.
        A woman's heart beat is faster than a man's
        by around 8 beats per minute.
        Your heart beating is when your heart
        pushes blood into your arteries.
        A normal rate is around
        60 to 100 beats a minute.
        An actual athlete may have
        around 40 beats a minute
        because of better cardiovascular fitness.

    <Fact name="Lungs">

      <FactA>
        Every cell in your body needs
        oxygen in order to live.
        The air we breathe contains
        oxygen and other gases.
        Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into
        the bloodstream and carried
        through your body.
        At each cell in your body, oxygen is
        exchanged for a waste gas
        called carbon dioxide.
        Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas
        back to the lungs where it is removed from
        the bloodstream and then exhaled
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        The lung on the left is smaller than
        the right in order to fit the heart.
        Babies are born with pink lungs but become
        darker as we breathe in more polluted air.
        You inhale about 730,000 cubic
        meters of air each year.
        Ribs move with every breath around
        5 million times a year.
        Special cells in lungs produce mucus.
        They serve as first line of defence against
        bacteria, dust and dirt entering your body.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        When humans breathe in or inhale,
        the lungs expand.
        This expansion is possible only
        when diaphragm squeezes.
        The diaphragm is actually a small
        dome-shaped
        muscles seated right below the lungs.
        You could live with just one lung,
        it will limit your physical ability,
        but you can still have normal life.
        The study of lung diseases is
        known as pulmonology.
        Asthma is a common disease that
        affects the lungs.
        Asthma attacks happen when your airways
        narrow after being irritated.
        The narrow airways make it hard
        for you to breathe in air.
        Pneumonia is a dangerous disease
        that makes it harder
        for your lungs to absorb oxygen
        from the air you breathe.

    <Fact name="Spine">

      <FactA>
        The human spine has 32 to 35 vertebrae.
        Without the spine, both organs and limbs
        would be useless.
        The spine contains nerve clusters which are
        directly linked to the brain.
        Sometimes the spinal cord does not need the
        brain to do it's job,
        in some situations it can send some messages
        to the muscles.
        All together the spine has 26 vertebrae, they
        are separated by,
        7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae,
        5 lumbar vertebrae, 1 sacrum and 1 tailbone.
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        The spinal cord is about 1 centimeter thick.
        Astronauts grow 1 or 2 inches upon returning
        from space because of gravity.
        The spinal cord has over 100 joints,
        at least 220 ligaments and over 120 total muscles.
        Babies have more vertebrae than adults,
        this is because some of the bones come
        together as we grow older.
        Giraffe's have the same number of
        cervical (neck) vertebrae as human's.
        If a spine were to be taken out of a human body,
        it can stand hundreds of kilograms.

      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        The spinal column is very important,
        it supports the weight of the body,
        it provide flexibility for movement,
        and is the central pathway for the nerves.
        One quarter of the spine is made of cartilage.
        There are 23 elastic disks between
        each of the vertebrae.
        These discs compress when we put pressure on them
        and decompress we the pressure is relieved.
        The disks have a cartridge casing, this helps the
        disk stay flexible,
        they also absorb the shocks that transfer to
        the spine when we are active.
