    <Fact name="Heart">

      <FactA>
        Your heart is in your chest
        and is protected
        by your rib cage.
        Blood is the fluid that provides the body
        with oxygen and nutrients.
        The heart is very important, it is the organ
        that pumps blood throughout the body.
        The study of the heart is cardiology.
        Blood that goes towards the heart is carried
        through tubes called veins.
        Blood that leaves the heart
        that goes to the other organs,
        Are carried through tubes called arteries.
        the ratio of red blood cells to
        white is 600:1
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        Average heart valve is
        the size of a
        half dollar coin.
        The first heart cell
        starts to beat at
        around four weeks.
        A blue whale has the largest heart.
        A heart is about the
        size of your two hands
        grabbing each other.
        Your heart beats about
        100,000 times a day.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        Your heart pumps around 788,400 gallons of
        blood each year, and 1.5 each day.
        A woman's heart beat is faster than a man's
        by around 8 beats per minute.
        Your heart beating is when your heart
        pushes blood into your arteries.
        A normal rate is around
        60 to 100 beats a minute.
        An actual athlete may have
        around 40 beats a minute
        because of better cardiovascular fitness.

    <Fact name="Lungs">

      <FactA>
        Every cell in your body needs
        oxygen in order to live.
        The air we breathe contains
        oxygen and other gases.
        Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into
        the bloodstream and carried
        through your body.
        At each cell in your body, oxygen is
        exchanged for a waste gas
        called carbon dioxide.
        Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas
        back to the lungs where it is removed from
        the bloodstream and then exhaled
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        The lung on the left is smaller than
        the right in order to fit the heart.
        Babies are born with pink lungs but become
        darker as we breathe in more polluted air.
        You inhale about 730,000 cubic
        meters of air each year.
        Ribs move with every breath around
        5 million times a year.
        Special cells in lungs produce mucus.
        They serve as first line of defence against
        bacteria, dust and dirt entering your body.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        When humans breathe in or inhale,
        the lungs expand.
        This expansion is possible only
        when diaphragm squeezes.
        The diaphragm is actually a small
        dome-shaped
        muscles seated right below the lungs.
        You could live with just one lung,
        it will limit your physical ability,
        but you can still have normal life.
        The study of lung diseases is
        known as pulmonology.
        Asthma is a common disease that
        affects the lungs.
        Asthma attacks happen when your airways
        narrow after being irritated.
        The narrow airways make it hard
        for you to breathe in air.
        Pneumonia is a dangerous disease
        that makes it harder
        for your lungs to absorb oxygen
        from the air you breathe.

    <Fact name="Spine">

      <FactA>
        The human spine has 32 to 35 vertebrae.
        Without the spine, both organs and limbs
        would be useless.
        The spine contains nerve clusters which are
        directly linked to the brain.
        Sometimes the spinal cord does not need the
        brain to do it's job,
        in some situations it can send some messages
        to the muscles.
        All together the spine has 26 vertebrae, they
        are separated by,
        7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae,
        5 lumbar vertebrae, 1 sacrum and 1 tailbone.
      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        The spinal cord is about 1 centimeter thick.
        Astronauts grow 1 or 2 inches upon returning
        from space because of gravity.
        The spinal cord has over 100 joints,
        at least 220 ligaments and over 120 total muscles.
        Babies have more vertebrae than adults,
        this is because some of the bones come
        together as we grow older.
        Giraffe's have the same number of
        cervical (neck) vertebrae as human's.
        If a spine were to be taken out of a human body,
        it can stand hundreds of kilograms.

      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        The spinal column is very important,
        it supports the weight of the body,
        it provide flexibility for movement,
        and is the central pathway for the nerves.
        One quarter of the spine is made of cartilage.
        There are 23 elastic disks between
        each of the vertebrae.
        These discs compress when we put pressure on them
        and decompress we the pressure is relieved.
        The disks have a cartridge casing, this helps the
        disk stay flexible,
        they also absorb the shocks that transfer to
        the spine when we are active.
      </FactC>


    </Fact>

    <Fact name="Ribs">

      <FactA>
        The ribs protect many internal organs,
        including the lungs. The ribs are flexible
        so that when the lungs expand, the ribs
        expand with them. The ribs are made from
        bone and cartilage. The first through seventh
        ribs are considered "true ribs" because they
        attack directly to the sternum. The eight
        through tenth pairs are called "false ribs"
        because the attach to the cartilage before the
        sternum. The last two pairs are called
        "floating ribs" because they don't attach to
        the sternum at all.

      </FactA>



    </Fact>
    <Fact name="Brain">

      <FactA>
        The brain is the center of the nervous
        system, it controls our thoughts,
        memories and actions. The largest part
        of the human brain is called the cerebrum.
        It is incharge of moving your body.
        Other parts include corpus callosum,
        cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum,
        hypothalamus, hippocampus and brainstem.
        The brain of an adult human weighs around
        3 pounds (1.5 kg). Although it makes up
        just 2% of the body's weight, it uses
        around 20% of its energy. The brain is held
        in Cerebrospinal fluid, it helps protect
        against impact and infections. The brain
        contains billions of nerve cells that send
        and receive information around the body.
        Each side of the brain interacts largely
        with the opposite half of the body
        for reasons that are not yet fully understood.

      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        The brain almost produces enough energy to light a light bulb.
        Yawning is the brain's way of cooling itself down.
        The brain is the only organ in the human body that has no nerves,
        so it can't feel any pain.
        The human brain is not as perfect as it is thought of since in many
        instances it has been found to fool human beings making them to perceive
        things differently from the reality.
        Your brain keeps developing until your late 40's.
        Your brain uses 20% of all the oxygen and blood in your body.
        Even though sometimes people say that the right part and
        left part of the brain are divided, they both actually work together.
        The frontal lobes control thinking, planning, organizing, problem solving,
        short-term memory and movement.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        The parietal lobes interpret sensory information,
        such as taste, temperature and touch.
        The occipital lobes process images from your eyes and
        link that information with images stored in memory.
        The temporal lobes process information from your senses of smell, taste and sound.
        They also play a role in memory storage.
        The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls the sensory information
        like sight, sound, taste, smell, and hearing.
        The limbic system is the part of the brain that controls emotions and memories.
        The peripheral nervous system is the nerves that makes sure that your brain
        sends the right information to the right side of you body.

    <Fact name="Skull">

      <FactA>
        The word "Skull" probably originated from the
        Old Norse work "Skalli" which means bald.
        The skull structures the face and protects
        the brain. An infant's skull has 44 bones.
        As the child developes, the bones fuse
        together. An adult's skull has 22 bones.

      </FactA>

    <Fact name="Bone">

      <FactA>
        A bone in the human body.

      </FactA>

    </Fact>
    <Fact name="Hand">

      <FactA>
        The hands consist of an average of 27 bones.

      </FactA>


    </Fact>
    <Fact name="Intestines">

      <FactA>
        The intestines are made up of 4 parts, the Small Bowel, the Colon,
        the Rectum, and the Anus. Or it could be broken up into two parts,
        the small and large intestine.
        The small intestine breaks down the nutrients that comes from the food,
        they then are carried into the bloodstream. after breaking
        that down it leads into the large intestine.
        The large intestine mostly pushes the stools towards the anus,
        but it also makes the vitamins B and K and other important proteins and acids.
        It also makes sure that it takes out all of the water from the stools.
        In an average adult, the small intestine is usually 16 feet.
        Most of the chemicals that helps the small intestine digest comes from the pancreas.
        Most humans will eat over 50 tons over a lifetime.

      </FactA>

      <FactB>
        It takes at least 12 hours to fully digest the food we eat.
        Honey is easy to digest because it has already been pre-digested by a bee.
        Muscles in the intestines can move food to even defy gravity,
        so we could technically eat upside down.
        Eating consumes up to 5 years of your life.
