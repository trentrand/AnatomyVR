        blood is the fluid that provides the body with oxygen and nutrients.
        The heart is very important, it is the organ that pumps blood throughout the body.
        the study of the heart is cardiology.
        blood that goes towards the heart is carried through tubes called veins.
        blood that leaves the heart that goes to the other organs, are carried through tubes called arteries.

    <Fact name="Lungs">

      <FactA>
        Every cell in your body needs oxygen in order to live.
        The air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases.
        Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body.
        At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide.
        Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from
        the bloodstream and then exhaled
      </FactA>

      <FactB>

        Babies are born with pink lungs but become darker as we breathe in more polluted air.
        You inhale about 730,000 cubic meters of air each year.
        Ribs move with every breath around 5 million times a year.
        Special cells in lungs produce mucus. They serve as first line of defence against bacteria, dust and dirt entering your body.
      </FactB>

      <FactC>
        When humans breathe in or inhale, the lungs expand.
        This expansion is possible only when diaphragm squeezes.
        The diaphragm is actually a small dome-shaped muscles seated right below the lungs.
        You could live with just one lung, it will limit your physical ability, but you can still have normal life.
        The study of lung diseases is known as pulmonology.
        Asthma is a common disease that affects the lungs.
        Asthma attacks happen when your airways narrow after being irritated.
        The narrow airways make it hard for you to breathe in air.
        Pneumonia is a dangerous disease that makes it harder for your lungs to absorb oxygen from the air you breathe.
